# floor9design/postcode-tools

This is a set of tools for getting relevant data from UK postcodes. 

## Summary

This repo offers some useful tools for processing UK postcodes. The UK postcodes have been released under the UK's 
National Statistics Postcode Lookup from the Office for National Statistics. It is open source, but there are 
restrictions (hstoric and ongoing) on processing and releasing this data. 

This set of tools should allow a user to take this and appropriately analyse for use by other people.
It will allow a processing of raw csv data from the ONS into a database, as well as other analysis tools such as a 
batch postcode lookup, postcode validator, and postcode distance calculator.

## Installation
